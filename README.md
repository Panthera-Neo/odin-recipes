What I have learned thus far before the project;

This is my first Odin project where I practice previously learned topics such as lists, paragraphs, italics, bold and setting up hyperlinks.

From this I have also learned how to create basic html page and its boilerplate and accessing this via a web browser. 

What I have learned thus far after the project;

I found the whole project quite interesting and insightful especially on areas I had not understood too well. 

Areas that I seem to have had a good grasp on:
- Creation of basic html document using the html boilerplate
- Basic manipulation of text in on a web page i.e. italics, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, and headings.
- Creation and organization of documents via the Terminal.

Areas that were challenged on this project:
- Copying files from local source to the GitHub repository. 
- Git commands and when to use them i.e git push, add, commit
- Commit messages : Where and when to use them. Actually, where to start off the git add command. Is this after you have finished the basic creation of the page? Or right after you've laid your plan out and now want to start on the detailing?
