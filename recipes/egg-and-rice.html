    <p><em>Gyeran Bap (Korean Egg Rice)</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Short-grain rice</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Neutral oil</li>
        <li>Green onions</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix hot cooked rice with butter until well combined. Transfer rice to a large serving bowl. (If you have leftover rice in the fridge, microwave it for 2-3 minutes until hot. If you don't have rice ready, please refer to Notes section below on how to cook it).</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat, add cooking oil and fry your egg sunny side up or however you wish. To fry sunny side up: fry the egg until you have nearly-set whites with runny yolks. To help the yolks cook faster, spoon some of the hot oil on top of the yolks.  This way your egg yolks will cook as fast as your whites so you don’t burn them.</li>
        <li>Place egg over top of buttered rice.</li>
        <li>Next garnish with sesame seeds, sesame oil, chopped green onions and soy sauce. Feel free to add as much of each ingredient as you wish.  ​Mix to enjoy! <em>You can also add other optional ingredients to take this to the next level, see ideas listed above.</em></li>
    </ol>
